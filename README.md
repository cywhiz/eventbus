# hypemaster

Prize winning hack for the [TicketMaster TfL hack day](https://blog.tfl.gov.uk/2017/06/09/june-16-tfl-and-ticketmaster-london-hack-day/) on June 16th.

Hypemaster is a simple mashup of the TicketMaster and TfL APIs as demonstration towards an idea...

The idea is a sort of a promotion tool, letting event organisers easily design bus stop poster advertising campaigns.
